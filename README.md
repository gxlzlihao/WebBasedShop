# Web Based Shop  

This project implements a web based book shop, uses J2EE framework. This project is the course project of the course [Software Architecture of Java](www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/pvarkjava/vt13/). I uses NetBeans 7.3 to develop this project. I use MySQL database to store the data and extract the data as xml files, then uses xslt to transformat the data to html webpages. My laptop system is MacOS.
